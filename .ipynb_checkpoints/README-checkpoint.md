MATHEMATICS OF POKER PYTHON COMPANION

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks to help you through the materials in The [Mathematics of Poker](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Poker-Bill-Chen/dp/1886070253)

For each part and chapter, I have a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates many of the mathematical concepts found in the book.
